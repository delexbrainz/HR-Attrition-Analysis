the "HR Attrition Analysis" project is  focused on understanding staff turnover by analyzing a dataset to identify key factors influencing employee attrition. 
An initial data cleaning was done to address missing values and inconsistencies, then used data visualization tools like Tableau to create insightful charts and dashboards. 
This analysis revealed patterns and trends related to employee departures, such as departmental attrition rates and contributing factors. 
The findings aimed to help improve retention strategies and optimize workforce management by pinpointing areas needing attention and intervention.
